When writing loops in python, things within the loop need to be tabbed. If there is a 
loop within a loop, then the things within the interior loop need to be double tabbed. Etc.

%paste% pastes whatever is copied into the command line

%run filename.whatever	runs an executable file within ipython. Your working terminal must
be set in the working directory where the file is located. Need a directory just for python
scripts.

Use meaningful names for variables when writing code for your homework and otherwise.

control c ends an infinite loop
